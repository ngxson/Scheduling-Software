Some SQL-queries (sqlqueries.txt) implemented

a) teaching by teacher per year (latest year default) like in Excel
SELECT distinct teacher.name, course.name FROM course, `course_implementation`, `course_implementation_teacher`, teacher WHERE `course_implementation_teacher`.teacherid = teacher.id AND course.id = `course_implementation_teacher`.`course implementationid` 

b)teaching by student group like in Excel (latest year default)


c)Student groups by degree program
SELECT * FROM `student_group` 

d)Teachers by degree program (teacher can teach in several degree programs)
SELECT teacher.name, student_group.degree_program from teacher, student_group, course_implementation, course_implementation_teacher where course_implementation.courseid = `course_implementation_teacher`.`course implementationid` 

e)Teaching by teacher per week (weeks)

f) numbers of hours working of teacher per year
SELECT distinct teacher.name,`course_implementation_teacher`.p1+ `course_implementation_teacher`.p2+`course_implementation_teacher`.p3+`course_implementation_teacher`.p4+ `course_implementation_teacher`.p5 FROM teacher, `course_implementation_teacher` WHERE teacher.id = `course_implementation_teacher`.teacherid
